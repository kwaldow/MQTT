# MQTT Telepresence System
This telepresence system that allows the connection of multiple AR or VR devices to create a shared virtual environment by using the simple MQTT networking protocol. It follows a subscribe-publish pattern for reliable and easy platform independent integration.

The MQTTTelepresenceSystem is a toolkit for mixed reality telepresence applications. This repository is part of our paper **Using MQTT for Platform Independent Remote Mixed Reality Collaboration** published in the Proceedings of the [Mensch und Computer 2019 Workshop on User-Embodied Interaction in Virtual Reality](http://muc2019.mensch-und-computer.de/)
